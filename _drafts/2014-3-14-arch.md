# Learning from Arch Linux
Arch is an open source, rolling release distribution. is a Linux distribution well-known for its extremely complete wiki. Almost certainly, you should have reached an Arch's wiki entry searching for troubleshooting about other  distributions.

If your're wiling to enlarge your knowledge about Linux, it's highly recommended trying to install Arch or another terminal-installation based distro al least once, because GUI linux installers made that task easier. On the contrary, Arch installation is completely based on terminal commands.

You can download Arch from [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_guide#Keyboard_layout).

[This](https://www.archlinux.org/download/) has been the guide followed to install Arch to a partition in my hard drive. You could also try it in a virtual machine!.

Beforehand you must know you're gonna need an Internet Connection to install Arch. The main goal of installing Arch is learning, so if you follow my steps strictly to the letter, you aren't gonna learn as much as if you found your own path. This would be handy in case you got stuck in a step.

## Booting from a usb in UEFI

The image of arch can be copied to an usb and made booteable by running ``dd`` as it follows:

~~~ bash
dd bs=4M if=/path/to/archlinux.iso of=/dev/sdx && sync
~~~

It would be sufficient to boot with Secure Boot disabled ([Here](http://fdavidcl.me/tagged/uefi) you've got some useful information about it)

Chroot desde ubuntu:
sudo chroot . /bin/bash
~~~ bash
mkdir arch
sudo mount /dev/sda8 arch
cd arch/
sudo mount -t proc proc proc/
nuwanda@nuwanda-Y50-70:~/Desktop/arch$ sudo mount -t sysfs sys sys/
nuwanda@nuwanda-Y50-70:~/Desktop/arch$ sudo mount -o bind /dev dev/
nuwanda@nuwanda-Y50-70:~/Desktop/arch$ sudo mount -t devpts pts dev/pts
mount --rbind /run run/
